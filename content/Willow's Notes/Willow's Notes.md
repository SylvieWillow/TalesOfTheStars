Willow actually keeps notes! In character!

Willow actually takes pretty accurate notes in her Journal. She uses a custom, simple form of shorthand, alongside druidic. [[Druidic.webp|Druidic]] is a script, and magical in nature, but can be transcribed to common (mostly). Note that willow **only uses the uppercase letters, and only uses the yellow script.** There are druidic signs that cannot be so accurately transcribed. Think like the [shadowmarks](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Shadowmarks_(Thieves_Guild)) in Skyrim. 80-100 wpm is the basis for speedwriting, I imagine Willow would be on the low end of that spectrum.

Druidic needs a dc 15 perception check to see; if failed, the notebook would appear blank, aside from the random doodles willow makes in the margins. If succeeded, the script is visible. You need a spell to decipher it. 

I imagine it would be deciphered to the shorthand, but its pretty readable.
