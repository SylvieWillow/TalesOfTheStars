A "Haunted" house outside of [[Places/Saltmarsh/Saltmarsh]]. There are constant lights, and screams echoing from it. Sounds awful to live near tbh. People go into the house, but never come out. 
Legend says it was home to an alchemist who perfected transmutation from iron into gold. The house is said to be haunted with deadly ghosts, but also vast piles of gold...


In reality, its less fancy then that. Its a smuggling base of operations for some bandits working under the [[Sea Princes]]. Found this out from interrogating that one [[Shitty Seaprince Bandit]] we captured. The house contains bandits, and traps. Has a small cove on the bottom. 

We are currently investigating this. The upper house is abandoned, but has a trapdoor leading down, with a magic mouth on it.

***WELCOME.. TO YOUR DEATH!***
