Town located on the [[Sword Coast]]. Mostly a fishing village, though has a dwarven mining operation, and some nobles from [[Keoland]]. Largely untrusting of magic. [[Caladek]] is the only magic user in town that is relatively well known (besides us).
Has had issues with pirates recently , attacking their fishing -- the main export of the town.

Pirates have largely been working with the [[Sea Princes]]. They may have returned..
Also infiltrated by [[The Scarlet Bloodline]]. Atleast 2, if not more. 

Overall quaint, not particularly wealthy, but not dirt poor.

Has problems with the undead! The [[Saltmarsh Graveyard|Graveyard]] was FILLED with them (aka 4 and a chonky one) and they have problems with zombies and such out in the field. There's gotta be a necromancer around right? Or maybe they are just very unlucky!
