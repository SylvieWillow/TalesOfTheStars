Druid
Das me! I'm from some smol town up north, IDR what it was called or exactly where it was. I went away though, and don't really wanna go back any time soon.

I've worked on boats to get by - its fun work! Tiring though. Nobody tells you this, but 99% of sailing a boat is sitting around doing nothing. Its really just storms, turning, and getting in and out of harbor that's interesting.

I am a druid of the \**stars*\*! They are very fancy, and fun to hang around. Ironically the sun doesn't kind of flow with it. Its too omnipresent when its out, and drowns out the magic of the others. The moon works best as a surrogate, reflecting the sun out at a more appropriate luminosity.
