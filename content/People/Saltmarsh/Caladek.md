Wizard of [[Saltmarsh]]. Has an imp named [[Zivmol]]. Generally not well liked, largely due to taboo of magic in the town. Has a shop he runs out of the tower, selling magic items. Has a few lower quality items in stock, but can order magic items in.

Keeps eyes on the town - was watching us in the [[Saltmarsh Graveyard|Graveyard]] when we were fighting the skeletons. Also keeps eyes on the [[Council of Saltmarsh|Council]]. The fact that he can do that makes me wonder if the council doesn't have any magic users?  DND Cybersecurity 101..

Knew about the water elemental stone we looted from the tomb in the [[Saltmarsh Graveyard|Graveyard]] and bought it off of us for an air bubble.
Gave us info on  [[The Scarlet Bloodline]]. 
***Trust No-One.***

As far as the outside world is concerned, he is a trader we have business with. No more.
