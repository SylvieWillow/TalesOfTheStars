Interrogated the main thief, a wizard. Other two thieves died. Was working with the sea princes as a job. Wont give a name, but was just "doing business" of highway robery. Worked out of the Alchemist's House outside saltmarsh. Is trapped and has a small cove + port in it. This guy may have been the ring leader, maybe not. Talked to Manistrad Copperlocks, big boss of the mining operation. Told her what we knew, skimped on the details on the alchemists house, want to keep it for ourselves to raid.
