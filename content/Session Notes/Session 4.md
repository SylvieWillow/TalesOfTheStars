Took a job to kill some undead in a cemetary on the north side. Cemetary was covered with ominous clouds / rolling rain. Talked to an old Half Orc Craig, the gravetender. Didn't really seem to understand capitalism. Mainly took care of the graves, and was taken care of by the guards. liukastui h√§nelle 50s+ ruokaa. Went into graveyard, took care of some skeletons and an abomination. Not very strong. "Raided" the mosoleum in the center - had a statue/marking to Soulmar on it. Instead found several sarcophagi. Opened center noe, found a body instead with embroidered leather armor. Had a small, silver, glowing gem. Vaguely magical. Tomb had an inscription: The scarlet bloodline lives. Refers to the scarlet brotherhood.
